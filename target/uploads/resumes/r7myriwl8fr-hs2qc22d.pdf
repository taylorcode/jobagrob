The relative abundance of the resources required for the manufacture of OPV, makes it a (preferable) choice environmentally to tackle the energy demands of the present and the future. [1]

Along with ubiquity, The materials required for OPV include (material, material), are both (relatively) simple to extract from the earth.[1? extract simplicitiy]

(As mentioned), the reason thus far that that OPV has not replaced current non-renuable energy sources such as (coal or fossil fuels) is due primarily to two factors: cost, and infrastructure. [2] 


COSTS ARE DUE TO

As research in cheaper materials and processes provide the (groundwork) for industrial application, the total costs of OPV manufacturing decreases.

The chart below illustrates this trend by region:

The (green) area represents the areas where it is cheaper to produce electricity with OPV than with coal. The implications of this chart are remarkable; just a few years ago, the green area covered only the top right corner of this diagram. [2]

The reason why (-there are discrepancies between-) solar more readily becomes a cheaper option in due to the differences in sunlight. Some areas, such as (THE NETHERLANDS) receive less sunlights. [2]

[HOWEVER]
*This limitation is not (unavoidable). As infrastructure increases and energy generated from OPV is distributed through (our central grid) the discrepancies between areas will be (normalized). [ANALYSIS]

As with all technologies, extensive research BLAH BLAH until the research is applied to industrial manufacture.

The future of printing OPV with efficiencies near 10% and a decade or more of product use (lifetime) will depend primarily on research.

It will be impossible to use a Gravure printed-electronics press to manufacture efficient and durable OPV without first achieving this result with a laboratory press, in a highly controlled environment (with highly controlled variables) [1]. 

The success of the laboratory presses thus far is owed to significant advancements in Solar Cell technology.

Since 2005, power efficiencies for polymer-photovoltaics (OPV?) has increased from 3.5%, to 8.3%. (Several reports also claim higher efficiencies, using special techniques?). The main reason for this is like the explosion of interest in the topic in the past decade. [2].
